    "# ProjectManager, PipelineManager and TaskManager\n",
    "Within the task hierarchy we can use the ProjectManager, PipelineManager and TaskManager to run a set of tasks and agents. They are all abstractions from BaseTaskManager which provides a communication system and the default execution logic. Regardless of the hierarchy each manager is assigned to a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Startup sequence\n",
    "Every execution run starts with a startup sequence, where the manager will verify it's resources, wait for task approval, fetch and resolve issues (if an issue handler is provided), fetch feedback from user or other agents, that will be added to the input prompt for the executing agent.\n",
    "## Execution sequence\n",
    "The execution sequence is the main loop of the manager, where it will execute the agents and tasks in the order they are provided. A Project Manager will initiate and run a Pipeline Manager for each pipeline in the project. Each Pipeline Manager will initiate and run a Task Manager for each task in the pipeline. Each Task Manager will initiate and run an Agent Executor and try to complete the task.\n",
    "The execution process returns either the agent final or an issue that may be due to an error or reported by the agent itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shutdown sequence\n",
    "The shutdown sequence will run after the execution sequence is completed. The shutdown sequence is responsible for verifying the results and updating the task status. If an issue is returned by the execution agent it will be reported to higher level managers. Basiclly the next higher manager with an issue handler will be responsible for resolving the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### !Note on Issues:\n",
    "To lay a fundament for a robust execution system we have implemented an issue system. An issue is a message that is passed between managers and agents. At the current state you can only use the simple issue handler which will just create a task for the human user to resolve. In the future we will add agents as issue handlers that can try to resolve the issue in the first place.\n"

    "# Running a PipelineManager\n",
    "From our previous example \"Demographic Report India\" we will run a pipeline manager for executing the pipeline.\n",
    "To use the pipeline manager we need to create Agents first and register them in the AgentRegistry. We register the agents with the AgentConfig, which is a simple BaseModel that holds the agent name and the agent_type and its tools or toolkit.\n",

    "### Defining Agents\n",
    "Mandatory fields for an AgentConfig are: name, description\n",
    "It should also have set either a list of tools or toolkit name. If both are set the toolkit will be loaded and the tools will be added to the toolkit.\n",
    "To report issues it is recommended to add \"ReportIssue\" tool to the agent.\n",
    "If no agent_type is provided the default AgentType will be ZeroShotAgent. But you can use any other agent_type from langchain. As well as define custom AgentTypes.\n",
