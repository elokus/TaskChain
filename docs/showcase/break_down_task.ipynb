    "# Key Concept Tasks\n",
    "The main building block of task_chain is the task object. A Task contains key information as: Name, Description, Typ, Inputs/Outputs, its relations to other tasks and states. A Task can have several types which mainly represent the hierarchy of the task within the big picture.\n",
    "We differentiate between the following Tasks:\n",
    "- **Project**: A high-level Goal.\n",
    "- **Pipeline**: A pipeline is a high-level task with the goal to achieve a milestone within the project. A pipeline contains a sequence of tasks which are all related to the specific milestone of the pipeline. You can also use a pipeline task as a standalone project if there is no need for multiple pipelines.\n",
    "- **Task**: A task is a single unit of work. That should be executed by a single Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "For more specific use cases we also defined Tasks of type:\n",
    "- **Issue**: An issue resolving task\n",
    "- **Subtask**: If we need to break down a task further down. Not in use yet.\n"

    "The initial building block for task chain is the decomposer. It takes a task and breaks it down into subtasks. This is done by sequence and sometime by an iteration of chains (see [Langchain Chains](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/getting_started.html)). After decomposing we want to have a tree structure of task objects.\n",
